# 🧠 Image Classification with Neural Networks  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates how to build an **image classification model using a neural network**. The model is trained to recognize and classify images into predefined categories. This kind of model is fundamental in computer vision tasks such as object detection, facial recognition, and medical image analysis.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Build a **feedforward neural network** for image classification.  
- Preprocess image data (e.g., normalize, reshape).  
- Train the model on a labeled image dataset.  
- Evaluate the model using accuracy and loss metrics.  
- Visualize predictions and training performance.

## 🛠️ Steps Performed

### **1️⃣ Data Preprocessing**  
✅ Load image dataset (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10, custom images).  
✅ Normalize pixel values to improve model convergence.  
✅ Reshape images as required by the neural network input layer.  
✅ Split dataset into **training and testing sets**.

### **2️⃣ Model Building**  
✅ Define a **sequential neural network** architecture using Keras/TensorFlow.  
✅ Include layers like:
- Dense (fully connected)  
- Dropout (for regularization)  
- Activation (e.g., ReLU, softmax)

### **3️⃣ Model Training & Evaluation**  
✅ Compile the model using loss (e.g., categorical crossentropy) and optimizer (e.g., Adam).  
✅ Train the model on the training dataset.  
✅ Evaluate performance on the test dataset using:
- **Accuracy**
- **Loss curves**
- **Confusion matrix**

### **4️⃣ Visualization**  
✅ Plot training and validation loss/accuracy curves.  
✅ Display sample predictions with actual vs. predicted labels.  

## 📂 Dataset Used  
- Contains labeled images (e.g., digits, objects, or custom images).  
- Each image has a corresponding class label.  

## 🔍 Future Enhancements  
🚀 Integrate **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for better performance.  
🚀 Expand to **multi-class or multi-label classification**.  
🚀 Deploy as a web app using **Flask or Streamlit** for real-time predictions.
