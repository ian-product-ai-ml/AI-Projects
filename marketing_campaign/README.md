# 📊 Marketing Campaign Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes **marketing campaign data** to uncover insights into customer behavior, spending habits, and promotional effectiveness. Using **exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and hypothesis testing**, we identify key factors influencing customer acquisition and engagement across different marketing channels.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Perform **EDA** to understand customer demographics and purchasing behavior.  
- Handle **missing values** and clean categorical variables.  
- Engineer new features like **total spending, age, and transaction volume**.  
- Identify patterns in **customer segmentation, shopping preferences, and campaign success rates**.  
- Test hypotheses related to **shopping habits, sales cannibalization, and regional differences**.  
- Use **visualizations (box plots, histograms, heatmaps, etc.)** for actionable insights.  

## 📊 Dataset Overview  
The dataset covers key aspects of marketing using the **4 Ps framework**:  
- **People**: Age, education, income, marital status, number of children.  
- **Product**: Purchases of wine, fruits, gold, and other items.  
- **Place**: Shopping channels (web, store).  
- **Promotion**: Campaign engagement, promotional offers.  

## 🛠️ Key Steps  

### **1️⃣ Data Preparation**  
- Filled missing **income values** based on education & marital status.  
- Cleaned **categorical variables** and encoded them for analysis.  

### **2️⃣ Feature Engineering**  
- Created new features:  
  - **Total Purchases** (sum of transactions across all channels).  
  - **Customer Age** (based on birth year).  
  - **Household Size** (total number of children & adults).  

### **3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Generated **box plots & histograms** to identify trends & outliers.  
- Created a **heatmap** to visualize correlations between customer attributes.  

### **4️⃣ Hypothesis Testing**  
✅ **Older customers** prefer in-store shopping over online channels.  
✅ **Parents with children** are more likely to shop online.  
✅ **Multi-channel sales strategies** might cannibalize physical store revenue.  
✅ **The U.S. has higher total purchases** compared to other regions.  

### **5️⃣ Business Insights & Recommendations**  
- **High-income & educated customers** tend to spend more.  
- **Online shopping is preferred** by parents and time-constrained customers.  
- **Underperforming products** require better marketing strategies.  
- **Campaign effectiveness varies** across different customer segments.
