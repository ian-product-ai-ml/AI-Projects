# 🧠 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) - Image Recognition

## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to perform **image classification**. CNNs are state-of-the-art models for visual pattern recognition and are widely used in fields such as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and facial recognition.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Construct a CNN model using Keras/TensorFlow.
- Train the model to classify images accurately.
- Apply data preprocessing and augmentation for improved generalization.
- Evaluate the model performance using accuracy metrics and visualizations.

## 🛠️ Steps Performed

### **1️⃣ Data Preparation**
✅ Load and inspect image dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10, MNIST, or custom set).  
✅ Normalize image pixel values to the range [0, 1].  
✅ One-hot encode class labels (if multi-class).  
✅ Split data into training and testing sets.

### **2️⃣ Model Architecture**
✅ Build a CNN with the following layers:
- **Convolutional Layers** – to extract feature maps  
- **Pooling Layers** – to reduce dimensionality  
- **Dropout Layers** – to prevent overfitting  
- **Flatten + Dense Layers** – to interpret learned features and classify

### **3️⃣ Model Training**
✅ Compile the model with:
- **Loss function:** Categorical Crossentropy  
- **Optimizer:** Adam  
- **Metric:** Accuracy  
✅ Fit the model on the training data with appropriate **batch size and epochs**.  
✅ Use **validation split** to monitor overfitting.

### **4️⃣ Evaluation & Visualization**
✅ Evaluate model performance on test data.  
✅ Plot training and validation **accuracy/loss curves**.  
✅ Display **sample predictions** with actual vs. predicted labels.  

## 📂 Dataset Overview
- Labeled image dataset with multiple classes (e.g., animals, digits, objects).
- Each input is a fixed-size image (e.g., 32x32 RGB).
- Ground truth labels used for supervised learning.

## 🔍 Future Enhancements
🚀 Use transfer learning with pretrained models (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet) to boost performance.
🚀 Apply data augmentation (e.g., flipping, rotation, brightness) to improve model robustness.
🚀 Deploy the model using Flask, FastAPI, or TensorFlow Lite for real-time predictions on web or mobile.
